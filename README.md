# IndRNN implementation in PyTorch

A PyTorch implementation for the IndRNN architecture following the paper [Shuai Li, Wanqing Li, Chris Cook, Ce Zhu, and Yanbo Gao. "Independently Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN): Building A Longer and Deeper RNN." CVPR 2018.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04831).

TODO: 
- Add more test data sets (for instance MNIST)
- Add comparisons to LSTMs and regular RNNs
